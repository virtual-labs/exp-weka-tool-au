          <h3 id="artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</h3>
          <p>Artificial intelligence in modern era have potential to make a revolutionary changes in every aspects of human life. The science of making intelligent computer by robust computing programs were begin in early 1950's from the concept “ Can machines think” by the  renowned scientist Alan Turing, who is known as the founding father of artificial intelligence and modern cognitive science. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and perform tasks that typically require human-like intelligence. Booming of artificial intelligence in the field of education, healthcare, industries, finance, transportation lead to the development of most innovative and promising technologies and tools that reduces humans physical and cognitive challenges.AI can be achieved through various methods, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. Deep learning and Machine learning were the two sub-fields of artificial intelligence combining with computer science and robust datasets.</p>

          <h3 id="deep-learning">Deep Learning</h3>
          <p>Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning which essentially involves an artificial neural networks with three or more layers. The neural networks were designed to stimulate human brain behaviours to learn large amounts of data. Deep learning drives many artificial intelligence (AI) applications and services that improve automation, performing analytical and physical tasks without human intervention. A wide range of applications of including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h3>
          <p>Machine learning is a subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time. It involves training a machine with large amounts of data, allowing it to identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on that data. Machine learning is used in a variety of applications, including image and speech recognition, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and autonomous vehicles. It has become increasingly popular in recent years due to the explosion of data and the availability of powerful computing resources that enable machines to process and analyse large amounts of data more efficiently. The basic components of machine learning include:</p>
          <p>•    Data: Machine learning models require data to learn from. The data can be in the form of structured or unstructured data.</p>
          <p>•    Model: A model is a mathematical representation of the data that is used to make predictions or decisions. The model is trained using the data and adjusted until it produces the desired outcome.</p>
          <p>•    Algorithm: An algorithm is a set of rules or procedures that a machine learning model uses to learn from the data. There are different types of algorithms such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.</p>
          <p>•    Training: The process of teaching a machine learning model is called training. During training, the model learns to recognize patterns and make predictions based on the data it has been trained on.</p>
          <p>•    Testing: After the model is trained, it needs to be tested on new data to see how well it can generalize and make predictions on unseen data.</p>
          <p>•    Evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated using different metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3 id="machine-learning-methods">Machine learning methods</h3>
          <p>Machine learning models are broadly divided into four types – supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
          &nbsp;</p>
          <h4 id="1----supervised-learning">1.    Supervised Learning</h4>
          <p>In supervised learning models, machines are trained by examples, ie a set of sample labelled data was provided to the machine learning system in order to train it, and on that basis, it predicts the output. Generally the operator gives the machine learning algorithm a predefined dataset with specified inputs and outputs, and the algorithm needs to figure out how to get those inputs and outputs. The algorithm recognises patterns in data, learns from observations, and generate the predictions (Fig.1). The algorithm predicts and is corrected by the operator and this process is repeated till the algorithm reaches a high level of precision. Precisely supervised learning is based on the supervision, i.e. the operator is aware of the response predicted by the machine learning algorithms and its main goal is to map the input data with the output data. </p>

          <p>&nbsp;
          Supervised learning can be grouped further in two categories of algorithms:</p>
          <p>•    Classification          </p>
          <p>•    Regression</p>
          <h5 id="classification-algorithms">Classification Algorithms:</h5>
          <p>In supervised learning, classification algorithms are used to predict a categorical variable or class label based on the features or attributes of the input data. Some of the commonly used classification algorithms in supervised learning are:</p>
          <p>•    Logistic Regression: This is a linear model that predicts the probability of a binary or multi-class output.</p>
          <p>•    Naive Bayes: This is a probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem that calculates the probability of a class given the features.</p>
          <p>•    Decision Trees: This algorithm uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences to predict the class label.</p>
          <p>•    Random Forest: This algorithm is an ensemble of decision trees that makes a prediction by aggregating the predictions of multiple decision trees.</p>
          <p>•    Support Vector Machines (SVM): This algorithm finds the best separating hyperplane between classes to make predictions.</p>
          <p>•    K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN): This algorithm finds the k-nearest neighbors of a data point and predicts the class label based on the majority class among them.</p>
          <p>•    Gradient Boosting: This algorithm combines multiple weak learners (e.g., decision trees) to create a strong classifier.</p>
          <p>•    Neural Networks: This algorithm uses a network of nodes (neurons) that process input data to predict the class label.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h5 id="regression-algorithms">Regression Algorithms:</h5>
          <p>In supervised learning, regression algorithms are used to predict a continuous output variable based on the input features or attributes. Some of the commonly used regression algorithms in supervised learning are:</p>
          <p>•    Linear Regression: This is a simple and widely used algorithm that models the relationship between the input features and the output variable using a linear equation.</p>
          <p>•    Polynomial Regression: This algorithm extends linear regression to capture non-linear relationships between the input features and output variable by adding polynomial terms.</p>
          <p>•    Ridge Regression: This algorithm is a regularized version of linear regression that adds a penalty term to the cost function to prevent overfitting.</p>
          <p>•    Lasso Regression: This algorithm is another regularized version of linear regression that uses the L1 regularization technique to encourage sparsity in the model.</p>
          <p>•    Elastic Net Regression: This algorithm is a combination of Ridge and Lasso regression that uses both L1 and L2 regularization techniques to balance between bias and variance.</p>
          <p>•    Decision Tree Regression: This algorithm uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences to predict the continuous output variable.</p>
          <p>•    Random Forest Regression: This algorithm is an ensemble of decision trees that makes a prediction by aggregating the predictions of multiple decision trees.</p>
          <p>•    Gradient Boosting Regression: This algorithm combines multiple weak learners (e.g., decision trees) to create a strong regressor.</p>
          <p>•    Support Vector Regression (SVR): This algorithm finds the best fitting hyperplane between the input features and output variable to make predictions.</p>
          <p>•    Neural Network Regression: This algorithm uses a network of nodes (neurons) that process input data to predict the continuous output variable.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h4 id="2----unsupervised-learning">2.    Unsupervised Learning</h4>
          <p>Unsupervised learning is a learning method in which a machine learns without any supervision. The machine learning programme examines the data to detect trends. There is no response key or human interference to provide guidance. Instead, the machine analyses available data to discover correlations and linkages. The machine learning algorithm is left to evaluate massive data sets and address that data in an unsupervised learning process. The programme attempts to organise the data in a way that describes its structure. This could imply organizing the data into clusters or structuring it in a more organised manner. As it evaluates additional data, its capability to make decisions based on that data increases and gets more refined. The main goal of unsupervised learning is to restructure the input data into new features or a group of objects with similar patterns (Fig.2).</p>
          <p>&nbsp;

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Unsupervised learning can be further classifieds into two categories of algorithms:</p>
          <p>•    Clustering</p>
          <p>•    Association</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h5 id="clustering-algorithms">Clustering Algorithms:</h5>
          <p>Clustering algorithms are a type of unsupervised learning technique that aims to group similar objects or data points together in a way that maximizes intra-cluster similarity and minimizes inter-cluster similarity. There are several types of clustering algorithms, including:</p>
          <p>•    K-Means Clustering: This is one of the most popular clustering algorithms. It involves partitioning data points into K clusters, where K is a predefined number. Each cluster is represented by its centroid, which is the mean of all the data points in that cluster. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the closest centroid, updates the centroids, and repeats until convergence.</p>
          <p>•    Hierarchical Clustering: This is a clustering algorithm that builds a hierarchy of clusters by either recursively merging smaller clusters (agglomerative) or dividing larger clusters (divisive). The result is a dendrogram that represents the hierarchy of clusters.</p>
          <p>•    Density-Based Clustering: This algorithm groups data points that are close to each other in terms of density. The clusters are formed around high-density regions and separated by low-density regions.</p>
          <p>•    Gaussian Mixture Models: This algorithm assumes that the data points are generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions. It tries to estimate the parameters of the Gaussian distributions and assigns each data point to the most likely distribution.</p>
          <p>•    DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): This algorithm groups together data points that are closely packed together and separates them from points that are far away. It can identify noise and outliers in the data.</p>
          <p>These clustering algorithms are useful in a variety of applications such as image segmentation, document clustering, customer segmentation, and anomaly detection.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h5 id="association-algorithms">Association algorithms:</h5>
          <p>Association algorithms are another type of unsupervised learning technique that aims to discover interesting relationships or patterns between different variables in a dataset. These algorithms are often used for market basket analysis, where the goal is to identify which items are frequently purchased together. Some popular association algorithms include:</p>
          <p>•    Apriori Algorithm: This algorithm is based on the idea of frequent itemsets, which are subsets of items that appear together in a transaction with a frequency greater than a predefined threshold. The algorithm generates a list of rules that indicate the likelihood of an item being purchased given the presence or absence of other items in the transaction.</p>
          <p>•    FP-Growth Algorithm: This algorithm is a variation of the Apriori algorithm that uses a frequent pattern (FP) tree to compress the data and speed up the computation of frequent itemsets. It generates a set of rules that indicate the association between items in a transaction.</p>
          <p>•    ECLAT Algorithm: This algorithm is similar to the Apriori algorithm but uses vertical data format to compress the data and speed up computation. It finds frequent itemsets by intersecting transaction lists.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h4 id="3----reinforcement-learning">3.    Reinforcement Learning</h4>
          <p>Reinforcement learning focuses on training agents to make optimal decisions in an environment. The goal of reinforcement learning is to develop algorithms that can learn from experience and improve their performance over time. In reinforcement learning, an agent interacts with an environment by taking actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The agent's goal is to learn a policy that maximizes its long-term reward. The agent learns by exploring different actions and observing their outcomes, updating its policy based on the rewards it receives. Reinforcement learning has a wide range of applications, including robotics, game playing, finance, and healthcare. Some popular reinforcement learning algorithms include Q-learning, SARSA, and deep reinforcement learning. Overall, reinforcement learning is a powerful approach to machine learning that allows agents to learn from experience and improve their decision-making over time</p>
